## Goal
Limit the amount of fresh produce that ends up in landfills by facilitating deliveries from grocery stores to food pantries.

## Ethereum solution

Implement a tracking solution for a cap-and-trade style system for food waste. Credits are earned through donations to food banks and can be traded freely between companies. Although cap-and-trade legislation is virtually nonexistent for food waste, a tracking solution could encourage the implementation of such systems.
